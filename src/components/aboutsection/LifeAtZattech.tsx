              When designing an app, careful planning is crucial to ensure a
              smooth development process and a user-friendly experience. The
              first step is to define the app’s purpose and target audience,
              focusing on solving specific problems or meeting user needs. Next,
              create wireframes and mockups to outline the app’s layout,
              features, and user flow.

            <p class="text-wrap text-xs md:text-lg mb-2 dark:text-white">
              It's essential to prioritize intuitive navigation, accessibility,
              and responsiveness across devices. User experience (UX) and user
              interface (UI) design should go hand in hand, emphasizing
              functionality while keeping the interface simple and visually
              appealing. Finally, iterating on feedback from early testing helps
              refine the app before moving into full development and deployment
              stages.
